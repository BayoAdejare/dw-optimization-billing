## Overview

This Optimized Billing Processor Data Warehouse project is designed to handle large-scale billing operations efficiently. It leverages data warehouse optimization techniques to process complex pricing models, high transaction volumes, and generate accurate invoices and reports. The solution utilizes Python for ETL processes and optimization strategies, while employing SQL for data manipulation and retrieval.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/optimized-billing-processor.git
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure your data warehouse connection:
   Edit `config/warehouse_config.yaml` with your database credentials and settings.

5. Set up the database schema:
   Run the SQL script in `sql/schema/billing_schema.sql` to create the necessary tables.

6. Load the stored procedures:
   Execute the SQL scripts in the `sql/procedures/` directory to create the required stored procedures.

## Usage

1. Run the ETL pipeline:
   ```
   python -m src.etl.extract_transactions
   python -m src.etl.transform_billing_data
   python -m src.etl.load_processed_bills
   ```

2. Generate invoices:
   ```
   python -m src.billing.invoice_generator
   ```

3. Run optimization analysis:
   ```
   python -m src.optimization.query_optimizer
   ```

4. Generate reports:
   ```
   python -m src.reporting.revenue_reports
   ```

## SQL Query Examples

### 1. Customer Billing Summary

```sql
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    COUNT(i.invoice_id) AS total_invoices,
    SUM(i.total_amount) AS total_billed,
    AVG(i.total_amount) AS avg_invoice_amount,
    MAX(i.invoice_date) AS last_invoice_date
FROM 
    customers c
JOIN 
    invoices i ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id
WHERE 
    i.invoice_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_id, c.customer_name
HAVING 
    COUNT(i.invoice_id) > 5
ORDER BY 
    total_billed DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

### 2. Product Usage Analysis

```sql
WITH monthly_usage AS (
    SELECT 
        p.product_id,
        p.product_name,
        DATE_TRUNC('month', u.usage_date) AS usage_month,
        SUM(u.usage_quantity) AS total_usage
    FROM 
        products p
    JOIN 
        usage_logs u ON p.product_id = u.product_id
    WHERE 
        u.usage_date >= DATE_TRUNC('year', CURRENT_DATE)
    GROUP BY 
        p.product_id, p.product_name, DATE_TRUNC('month', u.usage_date)
)
SELECT 
    product_id,
    product_name,
    usage_month,
    total_usage,
    LAG(total_usage) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY usage_month) AS prev_month_usage,
    total_usage - LAG(total_usage) OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY usage_month) AS usage_growth
FROM 
    monthly_usage
ORDER BY 
    product_id, usage_month;
```

### 3. Revenue by Region and Product Category

```sql
SELECT 
    r.region_name,
    pc.category_name,
    SUM(i.total_amount) AS total_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_id) AS customer_count,
    SUM(i.total_amount) / COUNT(DISTINCT c.customer_id) AS avg_revenue_per_customer
FROM 
    invoices i
JOIN 
    customers c ON i.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN 
    regions r ON c.region_id = r.region_id
JOIN 
    invoice_items ii ON i.invoice_id = ii.invoice_id
JOIN 
    products p ON ii.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN 
    product_categories pc ON p.category_id = pc.category_id
WHERE 
    i.invoice_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'
GROUP BY 
    r.region_name, pc.category_name
HAVING 
    SUM(i.total_amount) > 100000
ORDER BY 
    total_revenue DESC;
```

### 4. Customer Churn Risk Analysis

```sql
WITH customer_activity AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        MAX(invoice_date) AS last_invoice_date,
        COUNT(invoice_id) AS invoice_count,
        SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
    FROM 
        invoices
    WHERE 
        invoice_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 1 YEAR)
    GROUP BY 
        customer_id
)
SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_name,
    ca.last_invoice_date,
    ca.invoice_count,
    ca.total_spent,
    CASE 
        WHEN ca.last_invoice_date < DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 6 MONTH) THEN 'High'
        WHEN ca.last_invoice_date < DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 3 MONTH) THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Low'
    END AS churn_risk
FROM 
    customers c
LEFT JOIN 
    customer_activity ca ON c.customer_id = ca.customer_id
ORDER BY 
    ca.last_invoice_date ASC, ca.total_spent DESC;
```
